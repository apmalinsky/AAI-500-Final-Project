# Statistical Analysis of Student Performance
This project is a part of the AAI-500: Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD). 

## Installation
The code for this project is found within three separate Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks folder.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to investigate which factors have the greatest impact on final grades. These factors were derived from the selected data set titled “Student Performance,” taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository ([Cortez, 2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)). The data involves survey and questionnaire data among students in two Portuguese schools in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (Math) and Portuguese language (Port). The data is split into two tables, with one
table per subject. There are a total of 395 students in the Math table and 649 students in the Port table. Both tables have the same 30 independent features and 3 dependent features. For our analysis, the independent features were divided into three categories: Social, Demographic, and Academic. The dependent features represent first period (G1), second period (G2), and final grades (G3). We performed statistical analysis in each of these independent feature categories to determine the impacts of selected features on final grade outcomes. The notebook AppendixA-SocialFactors analyzes the impact of social factors on final grades. The notebook AppendixB-DemographicFactors analyzes the impact of demographic factors on final grades. The notebook AppendixC-AcademicFactors analyzes the impact of academic factors on final grades.

## Project Report
We include our final report where we explain in detail our analysis and conclusions. The final report can be found here: [Final Report](https://github.com/apmalinsky/AAI-500-Final-Project/blob/main/Final-Project-Report-Team-6.pdf).
